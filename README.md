# Insightful-Exploration-of-Netflix-movies
This group project delves into Netflix's visual universe with some fun facts and visualization using SQL, Tableau. I designed a robust data management system to improve data accessibility, analysis, and recommendation accuracy using insights from Netflixâ€™s dataset. Built a star schema in Erwin Data Modeler, performed data warehousing in SQL Server, and utilized SSIS for ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) processes. Final insights were visualized in Tableau, enabling more effective recommendation algorithms and strategic decision-making in the movie industry.

The ERD model is created with Erwin presenting logical entities (Movie, Creator, Movie_Creator, Director, Movie_Director, Actor, Movie_Actor, Genre, Movie_Genre, Content_Rating)
The .sql file stores the whole database after data cleaning while .twb file provides insights and visualizations.
